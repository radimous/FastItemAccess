avoid stack copies in the collection quest instead by using the item reference in [MixinCollectionQuest](https://github.com/radimous/FastItemAccess/blob/master/src/main/java/com/radimous/fastitemaccess/mixin/MixinCollectionQuest.java) (Server)  
restrict backpack capability checking to backpack items in [MixinIntegrationSB](https://github.com/radimous/FastItemAccess/blob/master/src/main/java/com/radimous/fastitemaccess/mixin/MixinIntegrationSB.java) (Client & Server)  
search the inventory for legendary bounty only when player is looking at the bounty block once per tick (instead of searching every tick regardless of visible bounty table) in [MixinClientBountyData](https://github.com/radimous/FastItemAccess/blob/master/src/main/java/com/radimous/fastitemaccess/mixin/MixinClientBountyData.java) (Client)
